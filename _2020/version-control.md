버전관리 시스템(Version control systems, VCSs)은 소스코드(또는 다른 파일들 혹은 폴더들)의 변화를 추적하기 위해 사용됩니다. VCSs는 이름에서 알 수 있듯이 변경된 사항들의 관리를 도와주며, 더 나아가 협력을 용이하게 합니다. 버전관리 시스템은 폴더와 폴더의 내용물의 변화를 일련의 스냅샷으로 추적하는데, 각각의 스냅샷은 최상위 디렉토리 내 파일과 폴더의 전반적인 상태를 `요약된 형태로 보관(encapsulates)`합니다. 또한 버전관리 시스템은 각 스냅샷의 생성자와 메시지 등의 메타데이터를 관리합니다.

버전관리는 어째서 유용할까요? 혼자서 작업할 때엔 프로젝트의 오래된 스냅샷을 보거나, 어떤 변경점이 왜 생성됐는지 로그를 유지할 수 있게 해주며, 동시에 여러 개발 브랜치에서 작업할 수 있게 해주는 등 많은 이유가 있습니다. 또한 다른 이들과 일할 땐 다른 사람들이 무엇을 변경했는지 보거나, 동시에 개발하며 생기는 충돌을 해결하기 위한 매우 귀중한 도구입니다.

현대의 버전관리 시스템은 다음과 같은 질문들의 답을 쉽게 (혹은 자동적으로) 알게 해줍니다.

- 누가 이 모듈을 작성했는가?
- 특정 파일의 특정 라인은 언제 수정됐는가? 누구에 의해서? 왜 수정되었는가?
- 지난 1000개의 수정들 중 특정 유닛 테스트가 고장난 건 언제, 누구에 의한 건가?

여러 버전관리 시스템이 존재하지만, 사실상 표준은 **Git**입니다.
이 만화는[XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/1597/) Git의 평판을 잘 보여줍니다.

![xkcd 1597](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

Git의 인터페이스는 leaky abstraction 이기 때문에, top-down 방식으로 배우면 (인터페이스 / 커맨드-라인 인터페이스로 시작하는 것) 크게 혼란스러울 수 있습니다. 몇 가지 유용한 명령어를 기억하고 이를 마법 주문이라 생각할 수도 있고, 뭔가가 잘못되면 언제든지 위 만화에서 얘기하는 것처럼 프로젝트를 지우고 새로운 복사본을 받을 수 있습니다.
(역자 주 - leaky abstraction란 추상화는 사용자의 입장에서 사용하기는 쉽지만, 그 기저의 원리를 알지 못하기에 어떤 문제가 발생하면 이를 이해하거나 해결할 수 없음을 의미합니다.)

Git은 명백히 못난 인터페이스를 지니고 있지만, 그 아래 깔려있는 디자인과 아이디어는 아름답습니다. 못난 인터페이스는 _기억_ 해야 하지만, 아름다운 디자인은 _이해_ 할 수 있다. 이런 이유로, 우리는 bottom-up 방식으로, Git의 데이터 모델부터 시작하여 나중에 커맨드-라인 인터페이스를 설명하겠습니다. 데이터 모델을 이해하고 나면, 명령어가 실제로 어떻게 데이터모델을 조작하는지 더 쉽게 이해할 수 있습니다.

# Git의 데이터 

There are many ad-hoc approaches you could take to version control. Git has a
well thought-out model that enables all the nice features of version control,
like maintaining history, supporting branches, and enabling collaboration.

## Snapshots

Git models the history of a collection of files and folders within some
top-level directory as a series of snapshots. In Git terminology, a file is
called a "blob", and it's just a bunch of bytes. A directory is called a
"tree", and it maps names to blobs or trees (so directories can contain other
directories). A snapshot is the top-level tree that is being tracked. For
example, we might have a tree as follows:

```
<root> (tree)
|
+- foo (tree)
|  |
|  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "hello world")
|
+- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is wonderful")
```

The top-level tree contains two elements, a tree "foo" (that itself contains
one element, a blob "bar.txt"), and a blob "baz.txt".

## Modeling history: relating snapshots

How should a version control system relate snapshots? One simple model would be
to have a linear history. A history would be a list of snapshots in time-order.
For many reasons, Git doesn't use a simple model like this.

In Git, a history is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of snapshots. That may
sound like a fancy math word, but don't be intimidated. All this means is that
each snapshot in Git refers to a set of "parents", the snapshots that preceded
it. It's a set of parents rather than a single parent (as would be the case in
a linear history) because a snapshot might descend from multiple parents, for
example due to combining (merging) two parallel branches of development.

Git calls these snapshots "commit"s. Visualizing a commit history might look
something like this:

```
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
            ^  
             \
              --- o <-- o
```

In the ASCII art above, the `o`s correspond to individual commits (snapshots).
The arrows point to the parent of each commit (it's a "comes before" relation,
not "comes after"). After the third commit, the history branches into two
separate branches. This might correspond to, for example, two separate features
being developed in parallel, independently from each other. In the future,
these branches may be merged to create a new snapshot that incorporates both of
the features, producing a new history that looks like this, with the newly
created merge commit shown in bold:

<pre>
o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- <strong>o</strong>
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- o <-- o
</pre>

Commits in Git are immutable. This doesn't mean that mistakes can't be
corrected, however; it's just that "edits" to the commit history are actually
creating entirely new commits, and references (see below) are updated to point
to the new ones.

## Data model, as pseudocode

It may be instructive to see Git's data model written down in pseudocode:

```
// a file is a bunch of bytes
type blob = array<byte>

// a directory contains named files and directories
type tree = map<string, tree | blob>

// a commit has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree
type commit = struct {
    parent: array<commit>
    author: string
    message: string
    snapshot: tree
}
```

It's a clean, simple model of history.

## Objects and content-addressing

An "object" is a blob, tree, or commit:

```
type object = blob | tree | commit
```

In Git data store, all objects are content-addressed by their [SHA-1
hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1).

```
objects = map<string, object>

def store(object):
    id = sha1(object)
    objects[id] = object

def load(id):
    return objects[id]
```

Blobs, trees, and commits are unified in this way: they are all objects. When
they reference other objects, they don't actually _contain_ them in their
on-disk representation, but have a reference to them by their hash.

For example, the tree for the example directory structure [above](#snapshots)
(visualized using `git cat-file -p 698281bc680d1995c5f4caaf3359721a5a58d48d`),
looks like this:

```
100644 blob 4448adbf7ecd394f42ae135bbeed9676e894af85    baz.txt
040000 tree c68d233a33c5c06e0340e4c224f0afca87c8ce87    foo
```

The tree itself contains pointers to its contents, `baz.txt` (a blob) and `foo`
(a tree). If we look at the contents addressed by the hash corresponding to
baz.txt with `git cat-file -p 4448adbf7ecd394f42ae135bbeed9676e894af85`, we get
the following:

```
git is wonderful
```

## References

Now, all snapshots can be identified by their SHA-1 hash. That's inconvenient,
because humans aren't good at remembering strings of 40 hexadecimal characters.

Git's solution to this problem is human-readable names for SHA-1 hashes, called
"references". References are pointers to commits. Unlike objects, which are
immutable, references are mutable (can be updated to point to a new commit).
For example, the `master` reference usually points to the latest commit in the
main branch of development.

```
references = map<string, string>

def update_reference(name, id):
    references[name] = id

def read_reference(name):
    return references[name]

def load_reference(name_or_id):
    if name_or_id in references:
        return load(references[name_or_id])
    else:
        return load(name_or_id)
```

With this, Git can use human-readable names like "master" to refer to a
particular snapshot in the history, instead of a long hexadecimal string.

One detail is that we often want a notion of "where we currently are" in the
history, so that when we take a new snapshot, we know what it is relative to
(how we set the `parents` field of the commit). In Git, that "where we
currently are" is a special reference called "HEAD".

## Repositories

Finally, we can define what (roughly) is a Git _repository_: it is the data
`objects` and `references`.

On disk, all Git stores are objects and references: that's all there is to Git's
data model. All `git` commands map to some manipulation of the commit DAG by
adding objects and adding/updating references.

Whenever you're typing in any command, think about what manipulation the
command is making to the underlying graph data structure. Conversely, if you're
trying to make a particular kind of change to the commit DAG, e.g. "discard
uncommitted changes and make the 'master' ref point to commit `5d83f9e`", there's
probably a command to do it (e.g. in this case, `git checkout master; git reset
--hard 5d83f9e`).

# Staging area

This is another concept that's orthogonal to the data model, but it's a part of
the interface to create commits.

One way you might imagine implementing snapshotting as described above is to have
a "create snapshot" command that creates a new snapshot based on the _current
state_ of the working directory. Some version control tools work like this, but
not Git. We want clean snapshots, and it might not always be ideal to make a
snapshot from the current state. For example, imagine a scenario where you've
implemented two separate features, and you want to create two separate commits,
where the first introduces the first feature, and the next introduces the
second feature. Or imagine a scenario where you have debugging print statements
added all over your code, along with a bugfix; you want to commit the bugfix
while discarding all the print statements.

Git accommodates such scenarios by allowing you to specify which modifications
should be included in the next snapshot through a mechanism called the "staging
area".

# Git command-line interface

To avoid duplicating information, we're not going to explain the commands below
in detail. See the highly recommended [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
for more information, or watch the lecture video.

## Basics

{% comment %}

The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository, with repository
metadata being stored in the `.git` directory:

```console
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/missing-semester/myproject/.git/
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

How do we interpret this output? "No commits yet" basically means our version
history is empty. Let's fix that.

```console
$ echo "hello, git" > hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   hello.txt

$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
[master (root-commit) 4515d17] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

With this, we've `git add`ed a file to the staging area, and then `git
commit`ed that change, adding a simple commit message "Initial commit". If we
didn't specify a `-m` option, Git would open our text editor to allow us type a
commit message.

Now that we have a non-empty version history, we can visualize the history.
Visualizing the history as a DAG can be especially helpful in understanding the
current status of the repo and connecting it with your understanding of the Git
data model.

The `git log` command visualizes history. By default, it shows a flattened
version, which hides the graph structure. If you use a command like `git log
--all --graph --decorate`, it will show you the full version history of the
repository, visualized in graph form.

```console
$ git log --all --graph --decorate
* commit 4515d17a167bdef0a91ee7d50d75b12c9c2652aa (HEAD -> master)
  Author: Missing Semester <missing-semester@mit.edu>
  Date:   Tue Jan 21 22:18:36 2020 -0500

      Initial commit
```

This doesn't look all that graph-like, because it only contains a single node.
Let's make some more changes, author a new commit, and visualize the history
once more.

```console
$ echo "another line" >> hello.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   hello.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add hello.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   hello.txt

$ git commit -m 'Add a line'
[master 35f60a8] Add a line
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Now, if we visualize the history again, we'll see some of the graph structure:

```
* commit 35f60a825be0106036dd2fbc7657598eb7b04c67 (HEAD -> master)
| Author: Missing Semester <missing-semester@mit.edu>
| Date:   Tue Jan 21 22:26:20 2020 -0500
|
|     Add a line
|
* commit 4515d17a167bdef0a91ee7d50d75b12c9c2652aa
  Author: Anish Athalye <me@anishathalye.com>
  Date:   Tue Jan 21 22:18:36 2020 -0500

      Initial commit
```

Also, note that it shows the current HEAD, along with the current branch
(master).

We can look at old versions using the `git checkout` command.

```console
$ git checkout 4515d17  # previous commit hash; yours will be different
Note: checking out '4515d17'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 4515d17 Initial commit
$ cat hello.txt
hello, git
$ git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was 4515d17 Initial commit
Switched to branch 'master'
$ cat hello.txt
hello, git
another line
```

Git can show you how files have evolved (differences, or diffs) using the `git
diff` command:

```console
$ git diff 4515d17 hello.txt
diff --git c/hello.txt w/hello.txt
index 94bab17..f0013b2 100644
--- c/hello.txt
+++ w/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello, git
 +another line
```

## Branching and merging

{% comment %}

Branching allows you to "fork" version history. It can be helpful for working
on independent features or bug fixes in parallel. The `git branch` command can
be used to create new branches; `git checkout -b <branch name>` creates and
branch and checks it out.

Merging is the opposite of branching: it allows you to combine forked version
histories, e.g. merging a feature branch back into master. The `git merge`
command is used for merging.

# Miscellaneous

- **GUIs**: there are many [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
out there for Git. We personally don't use them and use the command-line
interface instead.
- **Shell integration**: it's super handy to have a Git status as part of your
shell prompt ([zsh](https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt),
[bash](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt)). Often included in
frameworks like [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
- **Editor integration**: similarly to the above, handy integrations with many
features. [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is the standard
one for Vim.
- **Workflows**: we taught you the data model, plus some basic commands; we
didn't tell you what practices to follow when working on big projects (and
there are [many](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
[different](https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful)
[approaches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)).
- **GitHub**: Git is not GitHub. GitHub has a specific way of contributing code
to other projects, called [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
- **Other Git providers**: GitHub is not special: there are many Git repository
hosts, like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

# Exercises

1. If you don't have any past experience with Git, either try reading the first
   couple chapters of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) or go through a
   tutorial like [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). As
   you're working through it, relate Git commands to the data model.
1. Clone the [repository for the
class website](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester).
    1. Explore the version history by visualizing it as a graph.
    1. Who was the last person to modify `README.md`? (Hint: use `git log` with
       an argument)
    1. What was the commit message associated with the last modification to the
       `collections:` line of `_config.yml`? (Hint: use `git blame` and `git
       show`)
1. One common mistake when learning Git is to commit large files that should
   not be managed by Git or adding sensitive information. Try adding a file to
   a repository, making some commits and then deleting that file from history
   (you may want to look at
   [this](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/)).
1. Clone some repository from GitHub, and modify one of its existing files.
   What happens when you do `git stash`? What do you see when running `git log
   --all --oneline`? Run `git stash pop` to undo what you did with `git stash`.
   In what scenario might this be useful?
1. Like many command line tools, Git provides a configuration file (or dotfile)
   called `~/.gitconfig`. Create an alias in `~/.gitconfig` so that when you
   run `git graph`, you get the output of `git log --all --graph --decorate
   --oneline`.
1. You can define global ignore patterns in `~/.gitignore_global` after running
   `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`. Do this, and
   set up your global gitignore file to ignore OS-specific or editor-specific
   temporary files, like `.DS_Store`.
1. Clone the [repository for the class
   website](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester), find a typo
   or some other improvement you can make, and submit a pull request on GitHub.
